# ThingSpeak_Connection
This respository will be used to storage all the code made for a IoT project assigned by one of my teachers at university.

## WiFi Connection
On this folder you will find the interfaces and the wpa_supplicant.config files necessary to set up the Raspberry Pi wifi connection. Note than if your Raspbian version is new, you won't need the interfaces file.
